# Introduction 
Ever Wondered about background soundtrack added to the movies, those dhikyon sound of pistols, those footsteps sound, those car racing sounds? You need to hire sound artists to generate those kinds of sounds, and that art is called Foley.But what if you don't have that much money to pay to artist or for copyright usage, but instead have a computer and some knowledge of deep Learning. Well, then there is some good news for you. You can use a Deep Learning Model to generate a never-before music to your video without worrying about copyright issues with existing sounds. 
In this project we would explore the possibility of automating the process of Foley with the help of Deep Learning, and hence the name AutoFoley. 

# Flow ...
To Generate the music for a video, we must first recognize what's happening in the video, and then only we can generate the relevant music(not liked this, think what it would be to play funny music over a sad scene). 
So the project would be splitted in three parts : 
1) Recognizing the activity in video 
2) Generating Music
3) Stitching generated music to the video
